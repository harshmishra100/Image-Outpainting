A GAN-based solution for extending incomplete crop images using **residual skip connections** and **dilated convolutions**, designed to enhance agricultural analysis capabilities.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Addresses the challenge of incomplete crop images in agricultural datasets by:
- Generating **realistic image extensions** beyond original boundaries
- Enabling better disease prediction and growth pattern analysis
- Using **hybrid residual skip connections** for feature preservation

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **GAN Architecture** with U-Net-like generator
- **Dilated convolutions** for expanded receptive fields
- Dual **local + global discriminators** for consistency
- **MSE 0.0164 | MAE 0.0756** on Kaggle rice dataset
- Progressive training for GAN stability

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-outpainting.git
cd image-outpainting
